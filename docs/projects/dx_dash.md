# Weather App using Flask Framework

dx-Dash is a basic serverless Python-based web-application retrieving weather data through Weather-API calls.

The following technologies have been used:

- Dev-framework: [Flask Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- Visualization: [Plotly Framework](https://plotly.com/)
- CSS framework: [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- JavaScript: Vanilla JavaScript
- API services: [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/), [google-maps-api](https://developers.google.com/maps), [unsplash-api](https://unsplash.com/developers), [city database api](https://dev.me/products/city)

Deployed app on Render: [dx-Dash](https://dx-dash.onrender.com/)
